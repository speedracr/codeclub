# Codeclub

## Intro: You're starting here.
* check areas you already are somewhat comfortable with:
  * HTML/CSS
  * git
  * command-line
  * typing
  * Ruby
    * rbenv
    * gems
    * bundle, rack, rake
  * Rails
  * JavaScript
  * Sass/SCSS
  * S3 storage
  * server setup
  * Heroku deployment

## Explainer
* This is what programming is: client software (avoid), web app (easy),
  mobile app (advanced)
* web app: let me show you how this works - code, view, start a web
  server, open browser, done. Now imagine I have a computer running in a
  rack - simply by adding a config file for the web server, I can skip
  specifying the port and tell it which domain to watch out for.

  Production, staging, dev, test

* integrate with APIs: big topic. General idea: I make requests in a
  documented fashion, which then gets me reliable responses, either back
  into my app or as actions triggered (e.g. SMS sent or phone call made
  in the case of Twilio).

* design patterns
* devops: databases, server config. With a bigger user base, it'll
  become necessary to add more power in the form of app servers. In
  turn, we'll need to add a load balancer, plus orchestration.


## Make your roadmap
* suggested path
* make your own
* in any case: try and define start/stop points. Basic Rails can be fine
  and you don't need to start metaprogramming. Instead, see if you don't
  want to start with React or Swift.

* for each topic, click and get an overview of all online courses (lead
  gen!). Also see how many other members are using them and what they
  think.
  * Codecademy
  * Udacity
  * Treehouse
  * Lynda
  * Bitfountain
  * OneMonth
  * Codeschool

## Sponsorship
* lead gen for online courses
* technology providers like AWS, Stripe
* even better: sponsored content: tutorial on how to add Stripe or
  Braintree, how to set up Beanstalk on AWS, IAM
